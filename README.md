### stutor

Winning project of Uncommon Hacks by University of Chicago
sTutor is an efficient application for any undergraduate/graduate student who likes to study in a _group_. In most of the scenarios, a student don't get chance to ask doubts to the professor because they have not understood a concept/chapter/lecture. It is easier to ask doubts to your peers than a professor and as we said best way to lean is to teach.

After a user successfully logs in they will be presented with two option:

* To open a new tutoring session that their will lead.

* To join an existing session that matches their needs.

To become a tutor the user will be providing parameters like subject, topic, duration, place, max-attendees, discussion material. In a similar way the user who looks for a session can enter their information, and can choose from the list that he thinks is the best match!
